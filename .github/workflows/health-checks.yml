            ### Failed Steps
            One or more health checks have failed. Please check the workflow logs for details.
            
            ### Next Steps
            1. Review the workflow logs: [Link to run](${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            2. Check which scripts are failing
            3. Verify data integrity
            4. Test deployment process manually if needed
