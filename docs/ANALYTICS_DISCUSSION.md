# Analytics Discussion Summary

This document summarizes the analytics implementation and provides talking points for discussing the holistic approach with the repository owner.

## Issue Requirements

The original issue requested:
1. ✅ Evaluate analytics options: Plausible, Umami, Simple Analytics
2. ✅ Consider self-host or cloud deployment
3. ✅ Ensure no cookies
4. ✅ Document opt-out mechanism
5. ✅ Discuss holistic approach to pdoom1-website and pdoom1 architecture

## Implementation Decision: Plausible Analytics

### Why Plausible?

**Technical Advantages:**
- Open-source (auditable, transparent)
- Lightweight (<1KB vs 45KB for Google Analytics)
- Fast (no performance impact)
- Simple integration (single script tag)

**Privacy Advantages:**
- No cookies by design
- No personal data collection
- GDPR compliant by default
- Respects Do Not Track
- IP anonymization immediate

**Business Advantages:**
- Affordable cloud option ($9/mo)
- Free self-hosting option
- Easy migration between cloud/self-hosted
- Great documentation and community

### Alternatives Documented

**Umami:**
- Best for: Full self-hosting control
- Pros: Free (hosting only), similar features
- Cons: More setup complexity

**Simple Analytics:**
- Best for: Carbon-conscious hosting
- Pros: Simple interface, GDPR compliant
- Cons: Cloud-only, similar pricing to Plausible

## Holistic Approach: p(Doom)1 Ecosystem

### Current Architecture (from INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)

```
pdoom1 (game) ←→ pdoom1-website ←→ pdoom1-data (future)
                        ↓
                  PostgreSQL DB
```

### Analytics Integration Points

**1. Website Level (Implemented)**
- Page view tracking
- Download tracking (press page)
- External link tracking (about page)
- User opt-out controls

**2. Game Level (Future)**
- Game could report downloads via API
- Leaderboard submissions trackable
- No personal data shared

**3. Data Level (Future Integration)**
- Analytics API endpoints planned (INTEGRATION_PLAN.md)
- User privacy settings respected
- 90-day retention matches plan

### Privacy-First Design Principles

From INTEGRATION_PLAN.md, Section: "Privacy-First Design Principles"

✅ **Data Minimization**: Only essential data collected
✅ **Pseudonymization**: No identifiable information
✅ **Opt-in Systems**: User consent respected
✅ **Retention Limits**: 90-day automatic deletion
✅ **Encryption**: Data encrypted (Plausible handles this)
✅ **Access Control**: User controls via /privacy/ page

## Deployment Options

### Recommended: Cloud Hosting (Start)

**Why start with cloud:**
1. Fast deployment (10 minutes)
2. No infrastructure management
3. Automatic updates and maintenance
4. Easy to migrate to self-hosted later
5. Affordable ($9/mo for 10k pageviews)

**Migration path:**
- Start with cloud (quick validation)
- Migrate to self-hosted if traffic grows
- Export historical data available

### Alternative: Self-Hosting (Future)

**When to consider:**
1. Traffic exceeds 10k pageviews/mo
2. Want full data ownership
3. Have infrastructure capacity
4. Cost optimization needed

**Self-hosting setup:**
- Docker deployment (see ANALYTICS_SETUP.md)
- ~1 hour initial setup
- Free (hosting costs only)
- Full control and customization

## Discussion Points

### For Repository Owner

**1. Privacy Trade-offs**
- **Question**: Is Plausible's cloud hosting acceptable, or require self-hosting from start?
- **Consideration**: Cloud = easier, self-hosted = full control
- **Recommendation**: Start cloud, migrate if needed

**2. Analytics Scope**
- **Question**: Track beyond page views? (form submissions, video plays, etc.)
- **Consideration**: More tracking = more insights, but complexity
- **Recommendation**: Start minimal, expand based on needs

**3. Integration with Game**
- **Question**: Should game report analytics to same Plausible instance?
- **Consideration**: Unified dashboard vs separate systems
- **Recommendation**: Separate for now, integrate with pdoom1-data later

**4. Cost Considerations**
- **Question**: Budget for cloud hosting ($9/mo) or prefer self-hosting?
- **Consideration**: Cloud = time savings, self-hosted = cost savings
- **Recommendation**: Cloud for MVP, self-host if traffic grows

**5. Data Retention**
- **Question**: Is 90-day retention sufficient?
- **Consideration**: Longer = more trends, shorter = better privacy
- **Recommendation**: Start 90 days, matches INTEGRATION_PLAN.md

### For Future Architecture

**pdoom1-data Repository:**
When implementing the data service layer:
1. Analytics API can integrate with Plausible API
2. User privacy settings sync across systems
3. Single opt-out affects all services
4. Unified privacy dashboard possible

**Database Schema:**
Current INTEGRATION_PLAN.md includes analytics_events table:
- Can coexist with Plausible (web analytics)
- Game events tracked separately (gameplay analytics)
- Clear separation of concerns

**API Gateway:**
Future API can:
- Proxy analytics requests
- Enforce rate limiting
- Aggregate cross-system analytics
- Maintain privacy boundaries

## Implementation Status

**✅ Complete:**
- Analytics script integrated
- Privacy page with opt-out
- Documentation comprehensive
- Testing passed
- Ready for deployment

**⏳ Pending Deployment:**
1. Choose cloud or self-host
2. Configure Plausible account
3. Verify in production
4. Monitor for 1 week

**🔮 Future Enhancements:**
- More custom events
- Admin dashboard integration
- Automated privacy reports
- A/B testing (privacy-preserving)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Week)
1. ✅ Review implementation (this PR)
2. ⏳ Choose cloud or self-host
3. ⏳ Set up Plausible account
4. ⏳ Deploy and verify

### Short Term (This Month)
1. Monitor analytics data
2. Review opt-out rate
3. Adjust privacy messaging if needed
4. Document insights

### Long Term (3-6 Months)
1. Evaluate self-hosting migration
2. Integrate with pdoom1-data
3. Add game analytics
4. Unified privacy controls

## Questions to Discuss

1. **Hosting preference**: Cloud start or self-host immediately?
2. **Analytics scope**: Page views only, or track more events?
3. **Budget**: Comfortable with $9/mo cloud cost?
4. **Timeline**: Deploy now or wait for pdoom1-data?
5. **Privacy policy**: Need legal review before deployment?
