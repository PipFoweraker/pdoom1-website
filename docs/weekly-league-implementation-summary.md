- Client-side achievement calculation
- Extensible system for future additions

#### Achievement Categories

**Competition Achievements**
- [#1] **First Place** - Top rank in any week (Rare)
- [#2] **Silver Medal** - 2nd place finish (Uncommon)
- [#3] **Bronze Medal** - 3rd place finish (Uncommon)
- [***] **Perfect Week** - Win with 0% doom risk (Epic)
- [**] **High Scorer** - Score > 1000 (Common)

**Participation Achievements**
- [>>>] **Hot Streak** - 3+ consecutive weeks (Uncommon)
- [+10] **Regular** - Participate in 10+ weeks (Rare)
- [+25] **Veteran** - Participate in 25+ weeks (Epic)

**Performance Achievements**
- [SAFE] **Safety First** - Average doom < 20% (Uncommon)
- [RISK] **Risk Taker** - Win with doom > 50% (Rare)
- [UP] **Improver** - 5+ rank improvement (Common)

#### Technical Implementation
- Achievement definitions in `/assets/data/achievements.json`
- Real-time calculation in league standings
- Historical calculation in player profiles
- Rarity-based styling (colored borders)
- Hover tooltips for descriptions
- Responsive grid layout

#### Files Created/Modified
- `/public/assets/data/achievements.json` - Achievement definitions
- `/public/league/index.html` - Badge display in standings
- `/public/players/index.html` - Achievement showcase section

---

### Phase 5: Real-time Score Notifications ❌
**Status**: Deferred  
**Priority**: LOW  
**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 days + backend work  
**Reason for Deferral**: Requires significant backend infrastructure

#### Analysis
This feature requires:
- Backend streaming endpoint (SSE or WebSocket)
- Event publishing system
- Rate limiting and spam prevention
- Persistent connections
- Browser notification permissions
- Service worker for offline support (optional)

#### Recommendation
Defer to future sprint when:
1. Backend infrastructure is ready
2. User demand justifies the investment
3. Mobile app or PWA development begins
4. Real-time features become a priority

#### Alternative Solution
Current implementation uses polling with 30-second refresh:
- Adequate for most use cases
- No backend changes required
- Works with static hosting
- Could be improved to exponential backoff
