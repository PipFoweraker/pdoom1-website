## 🔮 Next Session Prep

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)
1. **Verify Auto-Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Check GitHub Actions
   gh run list --workflow=auto-deploy-on-push.yml

   # Verify site updates
   curl -I https://pdoom1.com
   ```

2. **Archive Completed Docs:**
   ```bash
   # Follow commands in SESSION_CLEANUP_2025-10-30.md
   mkdir -p docs/04-archive/2025-10-deployment
   # ... (see cleanup doc for full commands)
   ```

3. **Review GitHub Issues:**
   ```bash
   gh issue list --label deployment
   gh issue list --label accessibility
   # Close completed issues
   ```

### UI Improvements Queue
User requested "more UI patching" for next session:

**Potential Focus Areas:**
- Mobile responsiveness audit
- Form styling consistency
- Button state refinements
- Loading state improvements
- Error state styling
- Typography hierarchy
- Icon consistency
- Dark mode enhancements

**Suggested Approach:**
1. Audit current UI components
2. Create component inventory
3. Identify inconsistencies
4. Prioritize by user impact
5. Implement in batches

### pdoom-data Exploration
**Investigation Tasks:**
1. Clone pdoom-data repository locally
2. Review database schema
3. Check existing API endpoints
4. Identify integration points
5. Draft event schema RFC

**Questions to Answer:**
- What's the current deployment status?
- Which API endpoints exist?
- What's the authentication method?
- Who maintains the repository?
- What's the release cycle?
