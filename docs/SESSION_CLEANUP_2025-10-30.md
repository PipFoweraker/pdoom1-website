# Session Cleanup - 2025-10-30

## 🗂️ Files to Archive

These files represent completed work and should be moved to `docs/04-archive/`:

### Deployment Documentation (Now Automated)
```bash
# Move to archive - deployment is now automatic via GitHub Actions
mv DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md docs/04-archive/
mv DEPLOYMENT_READY.md docs/04-archive/
mv docs/02-deployment/ISSUE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md docs/04-archive/
```

**Reason:** We now have auto-deployment. These manual deployment docs are obsolete.
**Kept:** `docs/02-deployment/` guide for API deployment still relevant.

### Dashboard Documentation (Integrated)
```bash
# Move to archive - dashboard is now integrated
mv DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION_CHANGELOG.md docs/04-archive/
mv DASHBOARD_TESTING_REPORT.md docs/04-archive/
```

**Reason:** Stage 2 Dashboard is now integrated (Steven's PR #53). These are historical records.

### Automation Deployment Record
```bash
# Move to archive - this is a deployment record, not active docs
mv docs/03-integrations/2025-10-30-automation-deployment.md docs/04-archive/
```

**Reason:** Historical record of v1.1.0 deployment. Keep for reference, but archive.

# October 2025 Deployment Archive

Historical documentation from the v1.1.0 - v1.1.1 deployment cycle.

## Context
These files document the manual deployment process and dashboard integration that occurred before auto-deployment was implemented in v1.1.1.

## What Changed
- **Before:** Manual deployment via rsync/FTP
- **After:** Automatic deployment via GitHub Actions on every push to main

## Files
- `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Manual deployment steps (obsolete)
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - Pre-deployment checklist (obsolete)
- `ISSUE_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Deployment issue tracking (complete)
- `DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION_CHANGELOG.md` - Dashboard merge history (complete)
- `DASHBOARD_TESTING_REPORT.md` - Dashboard testing results (complete)
- `2025-10-30-automation-deployment.md` - Automation deployment record (historical)

## Current Documentation
See `.github/workflows/README.md` for current deployment procedures.

## 📊 GitHub Issues to Review

Check these for closure:

```bash
# List open issues related to deployment
gh issue list --label deployment

# List open issues related to accessibility
gh issue list --label accessibility

# List issues that mention "dashboard"
gh issue list --search "dashboard"
```

**Potentially Closeable:**
- Any issues about "manual deployment"
- Any issues about "deployment automation"
- Any issues about "accessibility improvements" (if we met the requirements)
- Any issues about "dashboard integration" (Stage 2 is merged)

## 🏷️ Git Tags to Consider

```bash
# Tag the current state as v1.1.1
git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Release v1.1.1: Auto-deployment, accessibility, and planning"
git push origin v1.1.1
```
