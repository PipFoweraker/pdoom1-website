## Deployment Automation

### Automated Pre-Deployment Checklist
The following checks run automatically before deployment:

1. **Version Validation**
   - Check version number incremented correctly
   - Validate changelog updated
   - Verify blog post exists (for major/minor versions)

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify all JSON files are valid
   - Check leaderboard data is current
   - Validate weekly league configuration

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test game data integration
   - Verify API endpoints respond
   - Check external dependencies

4. **File Integrity**
   - Ensure all critical files exist
   - Validate sitemap generation
   - Check content completeness

### Manual Deployment Process

#### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions
1. Go to Actions â†’ "Version-Aware Deployment to DreamHost"
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Leave defaults (unless emergency)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Monitor progress in Actions tab
6. Approve if prompted for major version
```

#### Option 2: Manual (Emergency Only)
```bash
# Local deployment steps
npm run deploy:prepare        # Run all pre-checks
npm run sync:all              # Sync all data
npm run deploy:verify         # Final verification

# Then trigger via GitHub Actions or SSH directly to DreamHost
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Quick Rollback (< 30 minutes)
If critical issue discovered immediately after deployment:

1. **Stop the bleeding**
   ```bash
   # Via GitHub Actions
   - Revert last commit: git revert HEAD
   - Re-run deployment workflow
   ```

2. **Notify users**
   - Update status page
   - Post in Discord/community channels
   - Twitter announcement if major

3. **Investigate offline**
   - Pull logs from DreamHost
   - Review deployment verification output
   - Identify root cause

### Standard Rollback (30 min - 2 hours)
For issues discovered during stream or monitoring period:

1. **Assess impact**
   - Is site functional? (if yes, can wait)
   - Are scores being lost? (if yes, immediate rollback)
   - Is it just a visual bug? (if yes, can hotfix)

2. **Execute rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous version
   git revert <commit-sha>
   git push
   
   # Or checkout previous version
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   # Create hotfix branch and force deploy
   ```

3. **Communicate timeline**
   - Announce on stream
   - Update users on expected fix time
   - Set expectations for next deployment

### Emergency Rollback (Critical)
For site-down or data-loss scenarios:

1. **Immediate actions** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Direct SSH to DreamHost
   ssh user@pdoom1.com
   cd ~/pdoom1.com
   
   # Quick restore from backup
   cp -r backup_YYYYMMDD/* .
   ```

2. **Use force deployment**
   - GitHub Actions with `force_deploy: true`
   - Bypasses version checks
   - Requires detailed notes in deployment_notes

3. **Post-incident**
   - Write incident report
   - Update rollback procedures
   - Add prevention checks

## Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Deployment Fails During Stream
1. **Stay calm on stream**: "We're experiencing a technical issue"
2. **Switch to backup content**: Show existing features, take Q&A
3. **Debug offline**: Check GitHub Actions logs
4. **Decision point** (10 minutes):
   - Can fix quickly? Do it live (good content)
   - Need more time? Postpone and reschedule
5. **Communicate**: Set clear expectations

### Scenario 2: Critical Bug Found on Monday
1. **Assess severity**: Can it wait until Friday?
2. **If urgent**: Hotfix procedure
   ```bash
   # Create hotfix branch
   git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
   # Make minimal fix
   # Increment patch version
   # Deploy via force_deploy if needed
   ```
3. **If can wait**: Add to Friday deployment

### Scenario 3: Game Repository Not Ready
1. **Friday 15:00**: Check game repo status
2. **If not ready**: 
   - Deploy website updates only
   - Skip game data sync
   - Communicate to users: "Game update coming in separate deployment"
3. **When ready**: Mini-deployment (Monday-Wednesday)

## Continuous Improvement
