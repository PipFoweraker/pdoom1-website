### ✅ Document rollback procedures

**Completed**: Yes

**Implementation**: Three-tier rollback strategy documented

**1. Quick Rollback (< 30 minutes)**
- **Use Case**: Critical issue discovered immediately after deployment
- **Procedure**:
  ```bash
  git revert HEAD
  git push
  # Re-run deployment workflow via GitHub Actions
  ```
- **Steps**:
  1. Stop the bleeding
  2. Notify users
  3. Investigate offline
- **Documentation**: `weekly-deployment-schedule.md` section "Quick Rollback"

**2. Standard Rollback (30 min - 2 hours)**
- **Use Case**: Issues discovered during stream or monitoring period
- **Procedure**:
  1. Assess impact (site functional? scores being lost? visual bug only?)
  2. Execute rollback:
     ```bash
     git revert <commit-sha>
     git push
     # Or checkout previous version
     git checkout <previous-tag>
     ```
  3. Communicate timeline
- **Documentation**: `weekly-deployment-schedule.md` section "Standard Rollback"

**3. Emergency Rollback (Critical)**
- **Use Case**: Site-down or data-loss scenarios
- **Procedure**:
  1. Immediate actions (< 5 minutes):
     ```bash
     ssh user@pdoom1.com
     cd ~/pdoom1.com
     cp -r backup_YYYYMMDD/* .
     ```
  2. Use force deployment:
     - GitHub Actions with `force_deploy: true`
     - Requires detailed notes in deployment_notes
  3. Post-incident:
     - Write incident report
     - Update rollback procedures
     - Add prevention checks
- **Documentation**: `weekly-deployment-schedule.md` section "Emergency Rollback"

**Rollback Decision Tree**: Documented in `deployment-architecture.md`

**Emergency Scenarios Covered**:
- Deployment fails during stream
- Critical bug found on Monday
- Game repository not ready
- Site completely down
- Data corruption detected

**Documentation**: 
- `docs/02-deployment/weekly-deployment-schedule.md` (rollback procedures)
