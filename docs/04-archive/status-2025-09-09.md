# Status checkpoint — 2025-09-09

Scope: pdoom1-website (static site on DreamHost + Netlify function for bug intake)

Done
- Roadmap and style-guide added; homepage nav wired (Roadmap, Steam)
- SEO: canonical/meta/OG/Twitter, en-AU locale, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- Bug intake workflow: `.github/workflows/bug-report.yml` (repository_dispatch → Issue with dedupe)
- Backlog scaffolding: labels, milestones (0.1.0 Website polish; 0.2.0 Steam readiness), initial issue set
- pdoom1 open issues snapshot at `public/docs/pdoom1-open-issues.md`
- Doc sync + issues sync workflows added (manual/scheduled)
- Default branch switched to `main`
- `public/config.json` apiBase set to: https://pdoom1-website-app.netlify.app

Pending
- Netlify site verification:
  - Ensure functions dir = `netlify/functions`, publish dir = `public`.
  - Env vars: `GITHUB_REPO`, `GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN`, `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`, `DRY_RUN`.
  - Redeploy and check Function appears under Netlify → Functions.
- Function health check:
  - GET https://<SITE>.netlify.app/api/report-bug should return `{ "status": "ok" }`.
  - If 404 persists, re-check functions path and redeploy.
- DreamHost deploy workflow:
  - Add secrets: `DH_HOST`, `DH_USER`, `DH_PATH`, `DH_SSH_KEY` (optional `DH_PORT`).
  - Run "Deploy to DreamHost (manual)" (dry_run first, then live).
- End-to-end test:
  - With DRY_RUN=true: form → 200 OK, no Issue.
  - With DRY_RUN=false: Issue created by workflow.
- Tighten CORS after testing: remove netlify.app from `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`.

Notes
- Twitter handle must be ASCII (recommend `@pdoom1`).
- Replace OG image with final 1200x630 asset when ready.
