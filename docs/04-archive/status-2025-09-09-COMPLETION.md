## ðŸ”„ Pending Items (from "Pending" section)

### Infrastructure Items (Cannot Be Verified from Repository)

These items require access to external systems and cannot be verified from the repository alone:

1. **Netlify site verification** - Requires Netlify dashboard access
   - Functions directory correctly set to `netlify/functions` in `netlify.toml` âœ…
   - Publish directory correctly set to `public` in `netlify.toml` âœ…
   - Environment variables cannot be verified without Netlify access
   - Function health check requires live deployment

2. **DreamHost deploy workflow** - Requires GitHub secrets access
   - Workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy-dreamhost.yml` âœ…
   - Required secrets check in workflow: `DH_HOST`, `DH_USER`, `DH_PATH`, `DH_SSH_KEY` âœ…
   - Cannot verify if secrets are actually configured

3. **End-to-end testing** - Requires live deployment and testing
   - Would need to test with DRY_RUN=true first, then DRY_RUN=false
   - Cannot be performed from repository inspection

4. **CORS tightening** - Should be done after testing complete
   - ALLOWED_ORIGIN configuration in Netlify function supports this âœ…
   - Timing depends on testing completion

### Open Issues Tracked

The following open issues relate to items mentioned in the status document:

- **Issue #16**: "Provide final OpenGraph image (1200x630) and update tags"
  - Current image: `public/assets/pdoom_logo_1.png` (1024x1536, 2.5MB)
  - Status: Using placeholder, awaiting final 1200x630 asset
  - Priority: Low

- **Issue #14**: "Add Search Console and Bing verification meta tags"
  - Status: Open, awaiting verification codes
  - Priority: Low

### Notes Section Items

From the "Notes" section of the status document:

1. **Twitter handle** - Comment in `public/index.html` line 18:
   ```html
   <!-- twitter:site intentionally omitted until handle is finalized (must be ASCII, suggest @pdoom1) -->
   ```
   - Status: Intentionally deferred until handle is finalized
   - No blocking issue

2. **OG image replacement** - See Issue #16 above
   - Current: Using pdoom_logo_1.png (not optimal 1200x630 size)
   - Status: Low priority, tracked by Issue #16

## ðŸ“Š Current Repository State (as of Oct 19, 2025)

  - Game repository integration
  - API server with 8 endpoints
  - Privacy-preserving analytics (Plausible)

### Active Development
The repository has progressed significantly since September 2025:

- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Weekly automated league resets
- Health check workflows
- Integration with multiple platforms (Railway, Render, Heroku)

### Open Issues Summary
- 8 total open issues
- Most are low-medium priority enhancements
- No critical blockers identified

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations

### For Repository Owner

1. **Infrastructure verification** (Cannot be done from code review):
   - [ ] Verify Netlify environment variables are set
   - [ ] Test Netlify function health endpoint
   - [ ] Verify DreamHost secrets are configured
   - [ ] Run end-to-end test with DRY_RUN=true
   - [ ] If tests pass, run with DRY_RUN=false
   - [ ] Tighten CORS after successful testing

2. **Low Priority Enhancements** (Already tracked by issues):
   - [ ] Decide on Twitter handle and update meta tags (if desired)
   - [ ] Create/provide final OG image 1200x630 (Issue #16)
   - [ ] Add search console verification tags when ready (Issue #14)

3. **Documentation**:
   - [x] Archive this status document (this completion review serves that purpose)
   - [x] Update Issue #19 with completion findings

### For This Review

All items that can be verified from the repository have been completed. The remaining items either:
- Require external system access (Netlify, GitHub secrets)
- Are low-priority enhancements tracked by existing issues
- Are intentionally deferred (Twitter handle)

**Conclusion:** The status checkpoint from September 9, 2025, is substantially complete. All code-level tasks are done, and remaining items are operational/deployment concerns that require platform access or are low-priority enhancements already tracked in the issue system.

## Next Steps

1. Close or update Issue #19 with findings from this review
2. Consider this status document archived and complete
3. Address infrastructure items (#1 above) when platform access is available
4. Low-priority enhancements can be handled through the normal issue workflow
