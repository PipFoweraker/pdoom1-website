## Troubleshooting

### If automation doesn't run:
1. Check GitHub Actions are enabled (Settings → Actions)
2. Check workflow files have no syntax errors
3. Manually trigger via GitHub UI
4. Check GitHub issues for auto-created failure alerts

### If front page shows "Error":
1. Check /data/version.json exists and is valid
2. Check browser console for fetch errors
3. Verify JSON files are being committed by automation

### If weekly league is stale:
1. Manual rollover: `npm run league:archive && npm run league:new-week`
2. Check weekly-league-rollover.yml is enabled
3. Check for GitHub issues about rollover failure

---

## Manual Override Commands

You can always run things manually:

```bash
# Update version and stats
npm run update:version
npm run update:stats

# Sync leaderboards
npm run game:sync-all

# Weekly league management
npm run league:status
npm run league:archive
npm run league:new-week

# Check everything
npm run deploy:prepare
```
