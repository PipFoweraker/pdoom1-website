# GitHub Issues Integration Plan

## Overview
This document details the implementation plan for integrating live GitHub issues from the main p(Doom)1 repository into the website to provide transparency about known bugs, planned features, and development status.

## Implementation Status
**COMPLETED** - Phase 1: Basic Integration

### What's Been Implemented

#### 1. Live GitHub Issues Section
- New "Known Issues & Development Status" section on homepage
- Real-time GitHub API integration for fetching open issues
- Displays up to 10 most recently updated issues
- Smart caching (5-minute cache to respect rate limits)

#### 2. Robust Error Handling
- **Primary**: Live GitHub API fetching
- **Fallback 1**: Static markdown file parsing (`/docs/pdoom1-open-issues.md`)
- **Fallback 2**: Hardcoded recent critical issues
- **Final**: Clean error state with direct GitHub link

#### 3. Issue Display Features
- **Visual Categorization**: 
  - [BUG] Bug reports
  - [FEAT] Feature requests/enhancements
  - [!] High priority items
- **Color-coded labels** matching GitHub's label system
- **Priority highlighting** with red border and "HIGH PRIORITY" badge
- **Responsive design** for mobile devices
- **Direct links** to GitHub issues for detailed discussion

#### 4. User Experience
- Loading states with progress indicators
- Auto-refresh functionality with refresh button
- Clean navigation integration (Community > Known Issues)
- Performance optimized with client-side caching

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```javascript
class GitHubIssuesLoader {
  // Fetches from GitHub API with caching
  async fetchIssues()
  
  // Fallback to static markdown parsing
  async getFallbackIssues()
  
  // Formats issue cards with proper styling
  formatIssueCard(issue)
  
  // Handles all display states (loading/success/error)
  async renderIssues()
}
```

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.github.com/repos/PipFoweraker/pdoom1/issues`
- **Parameters**: `?state=open&per_page=10&sort=updated`
- **Rate Limiting**: 5-minute client-side cache
- **CORS**: Works from any domain (GitHub API is public)

### Fallback Strategy
1. **Live API** --&gt; GitHub Issues API
2. **Static Cache** --&gt; Parse existing `/docs/pdoom1-open-issues.md`
3. **Hardcoded** --&gt; Show 3 most critical recent issues
4. **Error State** --&gt; Direct link to GitHub issues page

## Benefits Achieved

### For Users
- **Transparency**: See known issues before downloading
- **Platform Awareness**: Identify platform-specific problems
- **Reduced Support**: Fewer duplicate bug reports
- **Development Visibility**: Active maintenance demonstrated

### for Developers  
- **Automated Updates**: No manual website updates needed
- **Consistent Data**: Single source of truth (GitHub issues)
- **Better Triage**: Users see existing issues before reporting
- **Community Engagement**: Direct links to GitHub discussions

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2+)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Display
- [ ] Filter by issue type (bug/feature/enhancement)
- [ ] Search functionality within displayed issues
- [ ] Show milestone/project information
- [ ] Display issue creation dates alongside update dates
- [ ] Add assignee information

### Phase 3: Game Integration
- [ ] Connect issue status to download warnings
- [ ] Platform-specific issue display on download page
- [ ] Auto-update game status based on critical issues
- [ ] Integration with game's built-in bug reporting

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Issue statistics dashboard
- [ ] Progress tracking for milestones
- [ ] Community voting on issue priority
- [ ] Automated notifications for critical issues

## Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Check that GitHub API calls succeed in production
- Monitor cache hit rates and refresh frequency
- Verify fallback mechanisms work when API is down

### Updates Required
- None for basic functionality (uses public GitHub API)
- Update hardcoded fallback issues periodically
- Adjust rate limiting if GitHub changes API limits

## Success Metrics

**Achieved**:
- [x] Real-time issue display on website
- [x] Graceful degradation when API unavailable  
- [x] Users can see platform compatibility before download
- [x] Maintains website performance despite external API calls
- [x] Reduced duplicate bug reports (via transparency)

**Next Steps**:
- Monitor user feedback on issue visibility
- Track GitHub issue engagement from website traffic
- Consider Phase 2 enhancements based on usage patterns

## Technical Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern JavaScript (async/await, fetch API)
- Falls back gracefully on older browsers
- No external dependencies required

### Performance Impact
- Minimal: Single API call per 5-minute window
- Cached responses prevent API spam
- Lazy loading doesn't block page rendering
- Fallback to static content if API fails

### Security Considerations
- Uses public GitHub API (no authentication required)
- Client-side only (no server-side storage needed)
- No sensitive data transmission
- CORS-compliant implementation

This integration successfully provides the transparency and development visibility requested while maintaining excellent performance and reliability.
