# phpBB Forum Integration Plan

**Status:** Planning Phase
**Priority:** High
**Target:** v1.3.0
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies:** DreamHost access, domain configuration

---

## üéØ Objective

Install and integrate a self-hosted phpBB forum at `forum.pdoom1.com` (or `pdoom1.com/forum/`) to create a community hub for players to discuss strategies, share stories, report bugs, and connect with the development team.

**Inspiration:** Path of Exile's forum system (pathofexile.com/forum) - keeps conversation on-site, builds community identity, and enables future Steam integration for rewards.

## üìã Requirements

### Core Functionality
- [x] Self-hosted (no external dependencies)
- [x] Privacy-respecting (GDPR compliant)
- [x] Low maintenance overhead
- [x] Mobile-friendly interface
- [x] Integration with pdoom1.com design system
- [x] Single sign-on capability (future: Steam integration)

### User Experience Goals
1. **Low friction** - Easy registration and posting
2. **Engaging** - Clear categories, active moderation
3. **Rewarding** - Future: In-game cosmetics for contributors
4. **Community-driven** - Player strategies, feedback, fan content

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Hosting Setup
- **Platform:** phpBB 3.3.x (latest stable)
- **Server:** DreamHost (existing hosting)
- **URL:** `forum.pdoom1.com` or `pdoom1.com/forum/`
- **Database:** MySQL (DreamHost provided)
- **PHP:** 7.4+ (check DreamHost compatibility)

### Why phpBB?
‚úÖ **Mature & Stable** - 20+ years of development
‚úÖ **Self-hosted** - Full control over data and privacy
‚úÖ **Extensible** - Rich ecosystem of mods and themes
‚úÖ **Low Cost** - $0/month (uses existing hosting)
‚úÖ **Active Community** - Strong support and documentation
‚úÖ **SEO Friendly** - Good for discoverability

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Discourse: Heavy resource requirements, costly hosting
- Reddit-style: Less forum-like, harder to theme
- Discord: Ephemeral, no SEO, not on our domain

**Technical Implementation:**

5. Future: In-game "Submit Feedback" button opens forum

**Privacy Considerations:**
