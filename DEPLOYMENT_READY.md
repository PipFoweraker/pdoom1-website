## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Quick Start (Recommended): Railway

```bash
# 1. Create account at railway.app
# 2. Connect GitHub repository
# 3. Deploy from GitHub (railway.json auto-detected)
# 4. Set environment variables:
#    API_ENV=production
#    CORS_ORIGINS=https://pdoom1.com,https://www.pdoom1.com
# 5. Get your URL: https://your-app.railway.app
