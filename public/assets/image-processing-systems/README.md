    ├── bash-version/ (shell script implementation)
    └── python-hybrid/ (advanced Python implementation)
```

## 🎯 Purpose

These systems process raw cat images from `../cats-gallery/` to create optimized versions for:
- Web delivery (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
- Multiple sizes (thumbnail, small, medium, large)
- Multiple aspect ratios (square, wide, portrait, original)
- Metadata stripping and copyright addition

## 🚀 Quick Start

See `dump/README.md` for detailed information on each implementation.

## 📊 Processing Results

All 8 cat images successfully processed:
- **Python-Original:** 18 output files
- **Bash-Version:** 24 output files
- **Python-Hybrid:** 48 output files (⭐ recommended)

See `dump/PROCESSING_RESULTS.md` for complete details.
