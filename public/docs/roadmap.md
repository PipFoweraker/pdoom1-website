- Bug intake: Netlify function -> repo dispatch -> Issues
- Changelog automation from Airtable
- DreamHost static hosting + Netlify API
- Social syndication to Discord, Bluesky, X, LinkedIn

## 0.1.0 – Website polish
- Accessibility pass (ARIA, contrast, keyboard nav)
- Core SEO (meta, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OpenGraph)
- Analytics (privacy-preserving)
- Contact form hardening (hCaptcha optional)
- Design tokens pulled from `pdoom1` main repo

## 0.2.0 – Steam readiness
