# How p(Doom)1 Leaderboards Work

## Overview

The p(Doom)1 leaderboard system tracks player performance across different game seeds and economic models, providing a competitive platform for AI safety strategy gaming.

## Current System (v1.0.0)

### How Scores Are Recorded
- **Local Game Data**: Scores are saved locally in your game installation
- **Export Integration**: Real leaderboard data from `leaderboards/` folder in game repository
- **Website Display**: Exported data appears on the website leaderboard
- **Seed-Specific Tracking**: Each game seed has its own leaderboard

### Leaderboard Structure
```
📊 Current Leaderboards:
├── Seed-Specific Boards (e.g., "demo-competitive-seed")
├── Economic Model Tracking (Bootstrap_v0.4.1, Legacy, etc.)
└── Player Performance Metrics
    ├── Turns Survived (Primary Score)
    ├── Final Doom Risk Percentage
    ├── Economic Metrics (Money, Staff, Reputation)
    ├── Research Papers Published
    └── Technical Debt Accumulated
```

### Viewing Leaderboards

### Research Impact
- **Papers Published**: Academic contributions to AI safety
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated shortcuts and risks

## Planned Features (Coming Soon)

### Weekly Leagues (Q4 2025)
- **Reset Schedule**: New competitive seeds every Monday
