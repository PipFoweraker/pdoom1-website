# Website Navigation Redesign: From Clutter to Clean

*September 15, 2025*

## The Problem: Navigation Overload

When we first launched the p(Doom)1 website, we fell into a common trap: putting everything in the top-level navigation. Game info, leaderboard, blog, changelog, documentation, press kit, about page - all fighting for attention in a cluttered horizontal menu.

The result? A navigation bar that looked more like a desktop toolbar than a sleek game website.

## The Solution: Dropdown Hierarchy

Taking inspiration from classic game websites (and a nod to the Sid Meier naming convention), we implemented a clean dropdown system:

**Main Navigation:**
- **Game** - Direct to the core experience
- **Leaderboard** - Competitive rankings
- **Community ▾** - Blog, Updates, GitHub
- **Info ▾** - About, Documentation

## Technical Implementation

The dropdown system uses pure CSS with JavaScript enhancements:

```css
.dropdown-menu {
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  right: 0;
  opacity: 0;
  visibility: hidden;
  transform: translateY(-10px);
  transition: all 300ms cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
}

.dropdown:hover .dropdown-menu {
  opacity: 1;
  visibility: visible;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

## Accessibility First

We didn't just make it look good - we made it accessible:
- ARIA roles and labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Mobile-responsive behavior
- Focus management

## The Designer Credit

Following classic game industry tradition, we added "Pip Foweraker's" above the logo - a subtle homage to naming conventions like "Sid Meier's Civilization" that adds credibility and personal branding.

## Results

- **4 top-level items** instead of 7+
- **Cleaner visual hierarchy**
- **Professional game industry aesthetic**
- **Improved accessibility scores**
- **Better mobile experience**

The navigation now feels intentional rather than overwhelming, letting players focus on what matters: the game itself.
