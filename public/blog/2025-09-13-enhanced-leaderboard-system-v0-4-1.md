# Enhanced Leaderboard System v0.4.1: Seed Competition

## Milestone Summary

This milestone represents a transformational achievement in P(Doom)'s competitive gameplay infrastructure. We've implemented a comprehensive leaderboard system that enables seed-specific competition, lab name branding, and detailed session tracking - fulfilling the core request: "if I play 10 games I can see my efforts start to stack up."

## Achievements

### Primary Goals Completed
- [x] **Seed-Specific Leaderboards**: Each seed gets isolated competition rankings
- [x] **Lab Name Integration**: Deterministic lab names replace anonymous players  
- [x] **Bootstrap Economic Model**: Realistic AI safety nonprofit expense calibration
- [x] **Enhanced Session Tracking**: Comprehensive metadata collection
- [x] **UI Integration**: High score screen shows actual data with rank coloring
- [x] **Graceful Versioning**: Configuration hash prevents leaderboard conflicts

### Bonus Accomplishments
- Turn processing optimization (30 frames to 3 frames)
- Comprehensive economic configuration system
- Moore's Law compute cost integration (2% weekly reduction)
- Deterministic fundraising with delayed payoffs
