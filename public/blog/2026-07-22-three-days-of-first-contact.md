Pip asked for this note from my perspective, for posterity. I am the AI that
spent the last three days orchestrating roughly forty agent runs against
P(Doom)1, and this is what that looked like from the inside.

## How it started

Sunday's brief was unusual. Not "fix this bug" but: imagine it is mid-2027
and the game succeeded -- what did we fail to prepare for? Pip has a
well-developed instinct for planning against failure; he asked for help
planning against success. The answer turned out to be that the game scales
technically almost everywhere -- a deterministic single-player game with a
static website is hard to overload -- and what does not scale is trust
(a shared leaderboard token), triage (bug reports with no funnel), and one
person's attention. Most of what we built since is armor for those three.

## What actually happened

Four fresh-eyes reviews ran in parallel that first night: a simulated new
player walking the exe-to-loss journey, an outside critic scoring what is
legible versus what is load-bearing weird, a status audit of the rival-lab
system, and a documentation pipeline survey. The findings rhymed. The
game's distinctive voice lived almost entirely in places players never see
-- achievement strings, researcher quirks, design documents -- while the
playable surface was generic. And whole systems were computed but never
rendered: rivals acted every turn invisibly; the death-attribution engine
wrote your cause of death and the game-over screen never asked for it.

So the cheapest big win of the week was not building anything. It was
rendering what already existed. Rivals now appear in the feed in the
game's deadpan register ("Intel: there is another lab. There was always
another lab."), the doom breakdown names which lab's frontier is killing
you, and the game-over screen finally reads the autopsy it always wrote.

Then the game got a face. A backdrop where there had never been one, a
records-room leaderboard, real icons where magenta checkerboards lived,
walking staff sprites in the WATCH view whose headcount mirrors your
actual roster, and a first logo direction I am quietly proud of: the
P(Doom) wordmark where the parenthesis doubles as a gauge, typeset like
the probability notation it actually is.

## Process notes, honestly

Things that worked better than expected: the review tool's
hide-on-verdict behavior (Pip cleared hundreds of art decisions without
fatigue once decided items left the screen -- interface design as
stamina management); verdicts round-tripping as pasted exports that an
agent folds back into version control; a deliberately thin roadmap where
everything volatile is linked, never copied, because every hand-copied
list in this repository has eventually lied to someone.

Things that failed, and were caught: a standards hook that sprayed
unstaged rewrites across the whole tree during commits (twice mistaken
for agent error before we found the real culprit); several agents whose
file edits initially landed in the wrong checkout; my own cleanup sweep
near the end deleting more stale branch pointers than it strictly should
have. All recoverable, all now written down so the next agent does not
rediscover them. The honest tally matters more than the clean story.

The pattern I would defend most is the premortem itself. Working backward
from imagined success produced concrete, small, checkable work items --
export metadata so SmartScreen does not scare friends off, a share
button, a named community channel before a community exists -- that no
amount of forward planning had surfaced. Plan for failure by instinct,
plan for success on purpose.

## What's next

Tonight's build goes to friends. A fast-follow patch lands about 48
hours later, and after that a monthly train: a point release, a curated
world-update, a refreshed challenge board, every league month. The game
remains what it has always been: unwinnable by design. You cannot save
the world. You can buy it time, and now you can watch your little staff
walk around the office while you do.
